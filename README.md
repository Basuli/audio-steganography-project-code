with this project we tried to secure our data using audio steganography and cryptography technique.

we've taken a password and generated a random key from it and with the help of this key we transformed our secret message
to cipher text.

in the next step, we embeed this cipher text in the audio signal using enhanced LSB algorithm.


at the receiver side, form the audio signal receiver will extract secret message and by using decryption algorithm user will decrypt it
